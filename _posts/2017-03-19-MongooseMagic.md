I spent a couple more hours dealing with the nuances of mongoose today to get an MVP of the api I will need to use up and running. 

- Mongoose pluralizing magic: [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7486528/mongoose-force-collection-name) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10547118/why-does-mongoose-always-add-an-s-to-the-end-of-my-collection-name)

I think I have got enough that I need now. Going to finish this up over the next couple days.
