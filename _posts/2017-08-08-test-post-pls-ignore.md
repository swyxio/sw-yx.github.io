i am recovered from my flu and powering on. yesterday was a really really bad day and i actually forgot to blog. amazing. it was a combination of bad partner (who literally fell asleep on the keyboard) and acapella day and i signed my future apartment.

today it was testing day and we learned mocha and chai. the bootcamp does drive everything with TDD but we had never written tests from scratch before. while i enjoyed learning how chai might work behind the scenes (and also how insane TJ Holowaychuk is, he also wrote express), i found it a pain to write my tests without prompting.

a good couple testing resources found by ranjeet:
