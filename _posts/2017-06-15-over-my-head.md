I dont want to leave things half done and so am continuing to drown in icebob's [request for commit](https://github.com/icebob/vue-express-mongo-boilerplate/issues/48).

I did a [draft document for timecoin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gzYL2dAQEE_fwzWQuUuBjwlgPvlTjW7gudyiuld85wo/edit?usp=sharing) yesterday that got a lot of excitement but has since died. My reflection from this is that my instinct wasn't quite right and there is something missing, in particular a pressing pain point for this to be a blockchain solution. It just doesn't have to be.

I listened to [Meb's ideas podcast](http://mebfaber.com/podcast/) yesterday and it brought up the podcast summary idea which I quite like as a project. It still slightly exceeds my current capabilities.

I drafted [my outline for SED](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SYh-ciMeEwPgIMwKJwvwDS4fMtupeGcJlkam5wKRySs/edit?usp=sharing) to Jeff myerson and am still waiting for his feedback. meanwhile I have ordered the mics.
