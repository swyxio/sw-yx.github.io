today i did some more work on icebob's vemb but my interest is flagging primarily because this thing is an incomprehensible juggernaut. Actually I feel like if I spend enough time I might be able to learn icebob's framework, but when it comes to dealing with the intricacies of webpack I just give up. Who on earth thought this was a good idea?

anyway the discussion is here: <https://github.com/icebob/vue-express-mongo-boilerplate/issues/48>
